                  Python Image Artist<br>
                  March 2018, Computer Science and Engineering<br>
                  The objective of this project was to create a function in 
                  python that applied uniform layouts (geometric shapes, logos, 
                  outlines, etc) to a file of images for an imaginary ad 
                  campaign. I took turns coding with my partner, helped collect 
                  images to incorporate in our project, and helped to document 
                  information in and complete our design notebook. The toughest 
                  part of our project was figuring out how to iterate through 
                  the images in our file to apply the layout to every picture. 
                  I learned to pay attention to detail in our code in order to 
                  prevent errors, and that patience and diligence are great aids 
                  to solving a complex issue.

                  Python Hangman<br>
                  January 2018- February 2018, Computer Science and Engineering<br>
                  The objective of this project was to create a themed hangman 
                  game using python. I coded with my partner, researched certain 
                  features to incorporate in our game, and helped to document 
                  information in and complete our design notebook. The toughest 
                  part of our project was figuring out how to substitue the 
                  letters for the blank spaces in hangman without causing an 
                  error. As we tried to fix this issue, we ended up meesing up 
                  our entire code. In the end, we rewrote our code from scratch 
                  with just loops and such methods, then grouped the code into 
                  different function definitions. I learned that sometimes you 
                  must seek unconventional ways to solve a problem, and that 
                  just because you were taught one way, does not mean that way 
                  will always produce the desired results.

                  Python Text Adventure<br>
                  January 2018, Computer Science and Engineering<br>
                  The objective of this project was to create an interactive textual game 
                  using python. I took turns coding with my partner, 
                  helped research certain ideas to incorporate in our game, and 
                  helped to document information in and complete our design 
                  notebook. The toughest part of our project was figuring out 
                  how to get rid of the errors in our code. Once we solved one, 
                  another would pop up. I learned to pay attention to detail in 
                  our code in order to sort out any bugs.

                  App Inventor Project<br>
                  September 2017- October 2017, Computer Science and Engineering<br>
                  The objective of this project was to create a functional app 
                  using MIT App Inventor. I took turns coding with my partner, 
                  helped research certain ideas to incorporate in our game, and 
                  helped to document information in and complete our design 
                  notebook. The toughest part of our project was figuring out 
                  how to incorporate pictures into our app. In the end we 
                  realized that we had not downloaded all of our images to app 
                  inventor, which led to them not appearing in our app. I 
                  learned to pay attention to directions and review every tiny 
                  detail of our code in order to prevent any bugs.

                  Scratch Project<br>
                  September 2017, Computer Science and Engineering<br>
                  The objective of this project was to create a game using 
                  Scratch. I took turns coding with my partner, helped research 
                  certain ideas to incorporate in our game, and helped to 
                  document information in and complete our design notebook. 
                  Fixing the glitches and perfecting the gravity in our game 
                  were the toughest and most tedious challenges to overcome. 
                  This project gave me a better understanding of programming in 
                  scratch.

                  Modelling in Inventor<br>
                  May 2017, Introduction to Engineering and Design<br>
                  This was an independent project I completed. The purpose of 
                  this project was to create a 3D model of a stationary object 
                  and get practice working with 3D modelling software. The 
                  hardest part of this project was recreating the tiny, barely 
                  visible details of the lead case, such as the embossed letters 
                  or the tiny indentations in the bottom of the case. Overall I 
                  learned how to use various features in the software and that 
                  patience and accuracy are key to creating a good model.

                  Atmotu.0<br>
                  June 2016, Camp Bizsmart<br>
                  The objective of this project was to create a new and improved 
                  version of the already existing product known as Atmotube. As 
                  Chief Voice of the Customer(CVOC) in a company of seven, my 
                  role was to identify our target consumers, compare our product 
                  to our competition, identify consumer preferences, and gauge 
                  consumer responses to our product. I learned a lot about the 
                  inner workings of a company and the importance of 
                  communication and teamwork in a large group.
