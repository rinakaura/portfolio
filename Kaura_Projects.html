                  Modelling in Inventor<br>
                  May 2017, Introduction to Engineering and Design<br>
                  This was an independent project I completed. The purpose of 
                  this project was to create a 3D model of a stationary object 
                  and get practice working with 3D modelling software. The 
                  hardest part of this project was recreating the tiny, barely 
                  visible details of the lead case, such as the embossed letters 
                  or the tiny indentations in the bottom of the case. Overall I 
                  learned how to use various features in the software and that 
                  patience and accuracy are key to creating a good model.

                  Scratch Project<br>
                  September 2017, Computer Science and Engineering<br>
                  The objective of this project was to create a game using 
                  Scratch. I took turns coding with my partner, helped research 
                  certain ideas to incorporate in our game, and helped to 
                  document information in and complete our design notebook. 
                  Fixing the glitches and perfecting the gravity in our game 
                  were the toughest and most tedious challenges to overcome. 
                  This project gave me a better understanding of programming in 
                  scratch.

                  App Inventor Project<br>
                  September 2017- October 2017, Computer Science and Engineering<br>
                  The objective of this project was to create a functional app 
                  using MIT App Inventor. I took turns coding with my partner, 
                  helped research certain ideas to incorporate in our game, and 
                  helped to document information in and complete our design 
                  notebook. The toughest part of our project was figuring out 
                  how to incorporate pictures into our app. In the end we 
                  realized that we had not downloaded all of our images to app 
                  inventor, which led to them not appearing in our app. I 
                  learned to pay attention to directions and review every tiny 
                  detail of our code in order to prevent any bugs.

                  Atmotu.0<br>
                  June 2016, Camp Bizsmart<br>
                  The objective of this project was to create a new and improved 
                  version of the already existing product known as Atmotube. As 
                  Chief Voice of the Customer(CVOC) in a company of seven, my 
                  role was to identify our target consumers, compare our product 
                  to our competition, identify consumer preferences, and gauge 
                  consumer responses to our product. I learned a lot about the 
                  inner workings of a company and the importance of 
                  communication and teamwork in a large group.
